# 2025‑04‑19 Report

## Overview

Today we completed a major refactoring of the core engine modules (`play/` and `cards/`), introduced a robust macro‑driven effects registry, and achieved full test coverage across both subsystems.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Types Templating**  

   - Defined `CardTemplate(name, cost, type, data)` as the single canonical representation for all cards.  
   - Added convenience constructors:  
     - `Treasure(name; cost, coin_gain)`  
     - `Victory(name; cost, vp)`  
     - `Action(name; cost; kwargs...)`  
   - Exposed `card_info` to merge or isolate raw `data` fields into a `NamedTuple`.

2. **Player Module (`play/`)**  

   - Redesigned `State` struct: added `played` pile, reordered fields to “noun first,” and adhered to “module‑prefix” naming.  
   - `new(deck_starting; deck_shuffle=true)` supports optional shuffle.  
   - Provided simple getters: `deck_size`, `hand_size`, `played_size`, `discard_size`.

3. **Effects Framework**  

   - **Macro registration**: `@register :sym fn` registers an effect at compile time, warning on overwrite.  
   - **Dispatcher**: `dispatch(card, player, game; args=nothing)`  
     - Reads `card.data[:effects]` symbols  
     - Looks up each effect via `Registry.get` (now using `Base.get` to avoid recursion)  
     - Supplies either the keyed value from `card.data` or the fallback `args`.  
   - Improved parameter passing by using keyword args and per‑effect defaults.

4. **Cards Module (`cards/`)**  

   - Simplified `Registry`: `Dict{Symbol,CardTemplate}` with `set!`/`get`/`exists`/`list_cards`.  
   - Centralized macro `@register :Name expr` in `cards.jl`—no per‑file `using` needed.  
   - Enhanced `SetsLoader.sets_load!(; sets, cards)` to support both set‑level and card‑level filtering, matching filenames in lowercase to symbol inputs.

5. **Testing & Coverage**  
   - **Play tests** (`test_play.jl`): covers `Types`, `Player`, `Effects`, and macro registry without any dependency on `Cards`.  
   - **Cards tests** (`test_cards.jl`): covers `Registry` API, `@register` macro, and `SetsLoader` behavior.  
   - **Result**: 6 modules, 19 tests, **100% passing**.

## Next Steps

- **Refactor `game/` module**  
  - Design global game state (supply piles, trash, turn phases).  
  - Implement turn flow: Action → Buy → Cleanup.

- **Enhance Effects DSL**  
  - Support conditional and composite effects.  
  - Consider a mini‑DSL or additional macros for complex card logic.

- **Documentation & Reporting**  
  - Update `reports.md` with `game/` design diagrams.  
  - Add usage examples and a quick‑start guide.

- **CI & Quality Metrics**  
  - Configure GitHub Actions to run tests and publish coverage.  
  - Automate daily report generation and badge updates.

**Conclusion**  

The foundation for card definitions, player state, and effect dispatching is now rock solid and fully tested. Tomorrow we’ll extend this core into a full game loop and start wiring up actual gameplay.
