# 2025‑04‑21 Report

## Overview

Today we finalized the effects pipeline integration, streamlined card dispatch through atomic and composite flows, revamped the choose flow, and maintained a 95.8% test pass rate (8 units, 23/24 tests passing).

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Effects Pipeline Completion**  
   - Nearly completed integration of the composite `effects/pipeline` module for sequencing and branching atomic effects.

2. **Card Dispatch & Choose Flow**  
   - Enhanced the path from card dispatch to atomic effects, through the pipeline, into a unified choose flow.

3. **Testing & Coverage**  
   - Ran 8 unit suites with 23/24 tests passing, ensuring stability as pipeline features landed.

## Next Steps

- Polish remaining pipeline edge‑cases and conditional branches.  
- Expand choose strategies to cover more scenarios.  
- Begin wiring the full game loop into the pipeline.

## Conclusion

Significant strides today on pipeline and card processing. Tomorrow we’ll finalize pipeline polish and integrate the game loop.
