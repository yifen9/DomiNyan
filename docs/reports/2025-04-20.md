# 2025‑04‑20 Report

## Overview

Today we reorganized the codebase by moving and rewriting core game and tool modules, introduced a composite effects pipeline, revamped the play‑choose logic, and pushed our test coverage to 95.7%.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Project Structure & Module Reorganization**

   - Moved `game/choose` into `play/choose` to align naming with gameplay flow.  
   - Relocated `game/tracker` and `game/logger` into `core/tools` for clearer separation of cross‑cutting utilities.

2. **Core State & Logging Rewrite**

   - Completely rewrote `game/state`, `game/tracker`, and `game/logger`:  
     - Standardized state fields and ordering.  
     - Streamlined tracker events and logger output formats.  
   - Ensured all tool modules follow the “module‑prefix” naming convention and export only their public API.

3. **Play‑Choose Logic Overhaul**

   - Rewrote `play/choose` to simplify choice resolution and strategy loading.  
   - Introduced dynamic strategy discovery in the loader, decoupling strategy files from hard‑coded registration.

4. **Effects Pipeline**

   - Added `effects/pipeline` as a composite effects runner:  
     - Chains multiple effect functions in sequence.  
     - Supports early termination and branching based on effect results.  
   - Updated individual effects to emit standardized output for pipeline consumption.

5. **Testing & Coverage**

   - Expanded unit tests: now **22/23 tests passing** across 8 units (95.65% coverage).  
   - Added new tests for the composite pipeline and the reordered modules.

## Next Steps

- **Complete Pipeline Logic**  
  Finalize branching, rollback, and conditional execution within `effects/pipeline`.  
- **Enhance Core Effects**  
  Refactor `effects/core` for DRYness and better default parameters.  
- **Grow Strategy Suite**  
  Implement additional choose‑strategies to cover edge cases.  
- **Finish Base Set Cards**  
  Add remaining card definitions and associated effects for the base set.  
- **Refactor Tools**  
  Rewrite `tools/tracker` and `tools/logger` to use the new pipeline abstractions.  
- **Implement Game Loop**  
  Begin a full `game/loop` module: turn phases, supply management, and trash handling.

## Conclusion

Significant progress today on restructuring and the new effects pipeline. Tomorrow we’ll finalize the pipeline logic and start wiring up the full game loop.
